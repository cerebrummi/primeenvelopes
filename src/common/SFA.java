 *         Lemma: The equivalence of cutting in C and copy- pasting in CP:
 * 
 *         Step number n = 3: <‾MLMLMM> This means: <MLMLMM,MLMLMM, MLMLMM,
 *         M...infinity
 * 
 *         Removing the first letter leaves: <LMLMM, MLMLMM, MLMLMM, M...
 *         infinity
 * 
 *         This can be rewritten as: <LMLMMM, LMLMMM, LMLMMM, ... infinity
 * 
 *         Thus step number n = 4 is: <‾LMLMMM>
